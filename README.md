# Data-Preprocessing-and-Testing-of-Clustering-Algorithms-in-Scikit-learn-For-Internship-Project
This repository contains the work of an internship project conducted in throughout the period 10/07/2023 - 15/09/2023. The project aims to assess the performance of various clustering algorithms available in Scikit-learn library of Python on 9 different-sized datasets.

# 1. "Datasets" folder contains all the dataset files utilized throughout the project.
# 2. "ClusteringMethods-ScikitLearn.ipynb' is a Colab Notebook file containing the implementation code and the related visualizations.
